I'm a full-stack developer with over 7 years of professional experience specializing in building scalable web applications. My core expertise lies in modern frontend frameworks including React, Angular, and Vue.js, complemented by robust backend development using Node.js, Django, and Python. I have extensive experience with WordPress, Shopify, and WooCommerce, along with proficiency in database management and cloud services.

In addition to my primary full-stack development work, I offer supplementary services as a freelance graphic designer and content writer. I specialize in creating unique and compelling designs for logos, branding, websites, and print materials, while also crafting clear and engaging content that enhances the message of every project.

I also have extensive experience as a Unity developer, creating 2D/3D applications, interactive simulations, and game prototypes. Additionally, I utilize 3ds Max and SketchUp to create sophisticated 3D models, architectural visuals, and immersive design projects. Working with startups and established companies, I've always focused on understanding each client's goals and transforming their ideas into creative and effective outcomes.
